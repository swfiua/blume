 Requirements
==============

Since some maybe here just to get a `matplotlib.table` working in
matplotlib or just want to try examples with `blume.eggshow` no
requirements other than an appropriate version of `matplotlib` will be
required.

Some modules here may require `astropy` and/or `healpix`, but many
modules should just run fine.

All the interactive tools currently require `curio`.
