We live in an age of ubiquitous information.

Information, thoughts, ideas.  Everywhere.

But what is true and what is false?

What is designed to deceive, to prevent the reveal of a deeper secret?

How to test for truth?

We have our own first hand experience, and that of people we know and
trust, at least on some subjects.

We have observations of all kinds, forecasts too.

Plus ca change, plus la meme shoes.

Now if the weather forecast says its 30C in Ottawa and I go outside
and freeze, do I conclude they got the units or the sign wrong?

Over-time the thermometer in the pi should agree very well.

So if someone regularly reports a temperature different to the
observation, what can we conclude?

It is questions like these Gödel explored and proved a remarkable
theorem about mathematics.

There is a curious connection with Escher and Bach here.  The wonders
of self-referential systems.

Gödel proved that there were some statements in mathematics, that
always hold true, but for which there is no proof that it is so.

With the arrival of computers, this scotched the plan of some magical
algorithm to test the truth of any conjecture.

Mathematicians were back in business, ironically because they may be
working on things that were impossible to prove, yet also impossible
to disprove.  A doomed quest of eternal hope.

How many people about the world are intrigued by truths that cannot be
proven?  How many are working on problems that have already been
solved elsewhere.  Or are lacking some key bit of knowledge someone
else hase?

Gödel also studied Einstein's equations of general relativity.

These equations are difficult to solve, they are inherently
self-referential, which can pose lots of problems, most notably issues
of causality, since time is involved in the whole equation.

Minor details like this were unlikely to discourage Gödel.  He came up
with a solution based on the assumption of a giant rotating mass of
dust.

Time rotates too in this solution and at a certain, Gödel, distance it
starts to go backwards in time.

Perhaps there are symmetries where the time reversal part of the path
just unwinds the history, so that when it arrives back at its origin,
it is in exactly the same state as it left.  No information is
transferred in this process.

Are the only paths that go backwards in time those that are always,
locally, travelling at the speed of light?

Did Gödel suspect that these matters might lay in the realm of the
unprovable, due to the self-referential nature of Einstein's
equations?

Regardless of all this, the spirit of *blume* is not to be overly
concerned by whether something is possible or not, so long as it is
possible for some reasonable proportional of the time.

It is a magnificent excuse not to dig into theory, but I also find it
works for me as I write code.

This approach extends into the cosmology, asking the question of what
would a universe look like, if it worked as Gödel proposed?
