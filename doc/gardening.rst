==================
 Blooming Gardens
==================

When I came up with the name `blume` I was very much thinking of
*blooms* of flowers.

A place where seeds turn into seedlings and some eventually produce
flowers.

Scatter some seeds or plant carefully in a pot to germinate.

Take a cutting and place it in a new pot, see if survives the
transplant.

So, here is a place for some seeds of ideas that may blume into
flowers one day.

I typically write software to explore some data that I am interested
in.

Data that might answer some question I have.

In many cases a little exploration will rapidly result in more
questions than answers.

Rarely is the original problem solved, rather it is replaced by *n*
new problems that need to be solved first.

At this point there is typically a python module, a few hundred
lines. `argparse` to provide some options.

And in those hundred lines, *n* ideas all twisted together.

As with a garden, from a pile of seeds, what goes where?

First, get some things growing.

A month has passed, a month spent digging in the garden.

Moving earth and rocks around to build a mini of paths and
adventures.

Taking a cutting, akin to extracting a feature from some example I
have been working on.   Sometimes it takes like magic, others need a
little more work, with the possibility that its just not possible.

I am pleased with the pieces coming together in the `blume` garden.

Tools for browsing a world of data, sharing cuttings and codes for
making flowers.
