=====================================================
 BLUME, Better Looking, Universal, Matplotlib Engine
=====================================================

*blume*, like bloom, a place where seedlings, orphans looking for a
new home, to turn into flowers.




Better Looking
==============

BL big and little?

Universal
=========

Why not?

How?


Matplotlib
==========

Surfing data with matplotlib.


Engine
======

Matplotlib and python
=====================


Beginning with Tables
---------------------

The initial motivation for this

See `tabledotpy` for an account.

An initial *seedling* is `blume.table`.

The initial goal here is to provide an upgrade to the
`matplotlib.table` module.

There is a version here that tries to work around problems in the
current module.

There are improvements in the automat font sizing and cell padding and
some new options available.

In amongst all this are some changes to the API the module exposes,
where people may have written code to work around some limitation.

So the question remains how best to transition to the new table?

In particular,

  #. what does the end goal look like and

  #. do we need an interim fix to existing table?


It may be too early to decide, but if there is some sort of working
precedent to follow that would be great.

As far as the tables are concerned, my plan is to work on a few
examples, using tables in a variety of ways and see what ideas come
out from the API point of view.


Karma Pi too
------------

A personal tool kit for working on collecting analysing and displaying
data.  How to do this in a collabortive way?

A collection of 50 or so short python modules that provide some tools
for displaying and collecting data. Some aimed at a specific problem
or data set, others more general purpose.   Random explorations.

It is time to take some of the core ideas in karma pi and re-implement
them here.

Data
''''

A time, a place, a value.

And meta data explaining what the value represents.

But data often in rectangular grids with a particular focus on grids
which are just projections of grids laid on the surface of a sphere.

And finally
-----------

Interactive *matplotlib*, with *async* support.


Blume Zen
=========

*Everything is perfect, blume no longer exists.*

Big and Little.


Evolution of a module
=====================

An idea.  2-300 lines of code maybe?

Oh and I can start with *foo.py* which has half of what I need.

Hack around until it works well enough for current needs.

  #. it works

  #. it turns out to be rather more work than you had hoped

  #. it has created enough new ideas that it has been abandonned for
     now
     
  #. realised we have had this problem before and are going round in circles
