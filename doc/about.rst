 BLUME, Better Looking, Universal, Matplotlib Engine
=====================================================

*blume*, like bloom, a place where seedlings, orphans looking for a
new home, to turn into flowers.




Better Looking
==============

Universal

Matplotlib

Engine

Beginning with Tables
---------------------

The initial motivation for this

See `tabledotpy` for an account.

An initial *seedling* is `blume.table`.



Karma Pi too
------------

A personal tool kit for working on collecting analysing and displaying
data.  How to do this in a collabortive way?

A collection of 50 or so short python modules that provide some tools
for displaying and collecting data.

Data.  A time, a place, a value.

And meta data explaining what the value represents

Blume Zen
=========

*Everything is perfect, blume no longer exists.*





Evolution of a module
=====================

An idea.  2-300 lines of code maybe?

Oh and I can start with *foo.py* which has half of what I need.

Hack around until it works well enough for current needs.

  #. it works

  #. it turns out to be rather more work than you had hoped

  #. it has created enough new ideas that it has been abandonned for
     now
     
  #. realised we have had this problem before and are going round in circles
