 What does space time look like?
=================================

I have been puzzling over this paragraph for a week or so now, in
response to the earlier email::


  I never managed to make a *micro* theory of rotation as in b. with
  contributions from the various bits of a body and I think that this
  difficulty is one of the reasons for the fact that Mach's principle
  is not widely accepted.

  How do you see that GR captures this?


I have the story worked out in my head at this point, just struggling
to keep it short for now, but I think the model I have explains a lot
of the puzzles we see in our universe.

Everything is compatible with your new paradigm [NP], indeed the model
explained is inspired by the new paradigm. 

Guided by NP, it is rotations of matter that define inertial frames.

The neat bit is there nested rotations and you can zoom all the way in
to see the rotation of baryons.

Further, an inertial frame is just a rotation at each point in space
time.

Now what does it actually look like?

Hypothesis::

  If we could take a mesh of points and measure the angular velocity
  at each point the picture would vary smoothly.

  As we zoom in to higher and higher resolution meshes the picture
  remains smooth.

Rotating matter induces rotations in surrounding space time, but
everything varies smoothly, the waves propagating at the speed of
light. 

There is this other property of space time.  Think about the rotations
of any two bodies which are close to each other.

Hypothesis::

  

  
For baryonic matter we have:

    Mass of a proton: 1.67262192369(51)×10−27 kg

~ 10e19 planck masses, which has Schwartzchild radius 3.2 * 10e-35m

Schwartzchild radius of a proton: 3.2e-54 metres. 

Not this is a tiny fraction of the actual size of a proton.

But let's assume the mass in concentrated within this radius and that
R_s * \pi is the funamental wavelength of a proton.



Thermal equilibrium.
