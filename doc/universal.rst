 Universal, the U in blume
===========================

** Update: **

If you are for the universe, the *U* in *blume* is still very much
alive, as started a new project, `The Geometry of the
Universe<https:gotu.readthedocs.org>`

*blume* will focus on the core interaction with matplotlib.

The *gotu* project, requires *blume*.

Gravitational waves too perhaps?

Black hole mergers, modelled with a new paradigm.


Einstein with a twist
=====================

Many years ago, early 1980's I was fortunate enough to study
mathematics at Warwick University.

Christopher Zeeman had put together a wonderful department, including
Colin Rourke.

He gave lectures on *Real Analysis*, occasionally in wellington boots
having come from the farm.

Real analysis?  Calculus, but done differently.  With nested sets,
that Colin had introduced through his work at the *Open University*.

I will confess, I was more interested in algebra, group theory, Galois
and Fermat.

Colin's main interests were in the land of *topology*.

I left Warwick, years passed.   Then I heard someone had a proof of
the *Poincare Conjecture*.  It was Colin, but alas there was an error.
 
A few years passed another proof and this time Colin found the hole.

In 2006 Gregori Perelman, finally completed the proof.

By this time Colin had an increasing interest in cosmology, a natural
interest for a topologist.
 
By the wonders of modern communication I heard from Professor Ian
Stewart (paraphrased)::

   Colin Rourke has just published a book outlining a whole new
   paradigm on the universe.

   A theory that does not require dark matter.

The book was *A new paradigm for the universe* published in 2017. [0]

The book also focusses on galactic rotation curves, how the velocity
of stars varies with distance from the centre of their galaxy.

Typical curves show a straight line through the origin, which
transitions to a flat asymptote with a constant velocity of around
300km/s.

Unfortunately, such curves cannot be produce by conventional physics.
Vera Rubin [2] uncovered this problem and introduced the idea of *dark
matter* as a potential solution.

Colin takes a different approach.  He modifies Einstein's General
Relativity by assuming that a rotating body drags inertial frames in
the direction of rotation, with the effect proportional to the mass
and angular velocity and inversely proportional to the distance from
the body.

There are a number of compelling reasons to support this assumption:

* galactic rotation curves now match the observations

* it provides a mechanism for distant matter to define inertial frames

* it provides a mechanism that slowly redshifts light as it passes
  across the cosmos, due to drag from giant galactic black holes.

* it does not require dark matter.

* it may throw new insights on motions of binary star systems.

* it helps explain the thermal nature of the cosmic microwave background.

* shows the universe may be very much larger than conventional
  estimates, both in time and space.

Returning to topology, the book uses *de Sitter space* as a model for
the universe::

  In essence, what is provided here is a totally new paradigm for the
  universe.  In this paradigm, there is no big bang, and the universe
  is many orders of magnitude older than current estimates for its
  age.  Indeed there is no natural limit for its age.  The new model
  for the underlying space-time of the universe is based on a
  relativistic analogue of the sphere, known as *de Sitter space*.
  
  This is a highly symmetrical space which makes the model fully
  Copernican in both space and time.  By contrast the current standard
  model of mainstream cosmology is Copernican only in space and not in
  time.  This means that the view of the universe expounded here is
  similar to the steady state theory proposed and defended by Fred
  Hoyle (and others) in the last century, but it is not the same as
  their theory, which proposed an unnatural continuous creation
  hypothesis; like the big bang, this hypothesis breaks commonly
  accepted conservation laws.


Tired light
===========

The further light travels through space, the more it is red-shifted,
hence light from more distant galaxies appears more red-shifted giving
the illusion that galaxies are receding faster and faster the more
distance they are.

In [1] Edward Wright argues that simply stretching light from distant
galaxies would not give the thermal energy distribution that we
observe for the cosmic microwave background (CMB), so dismisses this
theory.


Cosmic microwave background
===========================

As noted the energy distribution of the cosmic microwave is very close
to thermal with a temperature of ~2.73K. 

According to the new paradigm (NP) the CMB originates in the form of light
from very distant galaxies.

Over 95% of that energy coming from galaxies that have never yet been
in our visible universe, beyond the Hubble distance.

So how does this light, in the form of microwaves make its way to us?
Surely, light from beyond the Hubble distance can never reach us since
it will be infinitely red shifted by the intervening space.

The answer may be cosmic dust.  Intergalactic space dust.  All at a
temperature of 2.73K.

Once light from distant galaxies has been redshifted by z = 1000 it
enters the microwave range.

Now there are so many distant galaxies contributing to the energy at a
point in space that it is able to maintain a temperature of 2.73K.

Sooner or later a photon will encounter some dust and be absorbed and
then re-emitted.

This is the perfect scenario for producing thermal radiation.

So whilst there is a tendency for light to be red shifted as it
travels across the cosmos, once it reaches the microwave level, then
we reach a point of thermal equilibrium.

Light from distant galaxies can travel arbitrarily long distances
through this thermalisation process.

Harmonics
=========

Spherical harmonic analysis of the cosmic microwave data reveals
intriguing harmonics within the data, with wavelengths of the order of
500 million light years.

Since interstellar cosmic dust is a key part of the thermalisation
process it is reasonable to assume that what the harmonics reflect
harmonics in the movements of cosmic dust.

Galaxies driving tides in the inter stellar dust.


New Arrivals
============

The book also provides an explanation for gamma ray bursts.
Conventional cosmology assumes these are caused by very distant,
extremely powerful emitters.

The explanation in the book comes from considering geodesics in de
Sitter Space.  Specifically, considering how light travels between a
distant emitter and an observer.

Due to symmetries in de Sitter Space all such geodesics follow
essentially the same pattern

When a new emitter is first seen by an observer, the observer sees its
entire history in a very brief period of time.  Hence the intense,
gamma-ray radiation::

  We propose, however, that many gamma-ray bursts may be optical
  illusions. If space-time is geodesically complete but an emitting
  object does not illuminate the whole of space-time, then on our
  entry into the illuminated region we see the emitter infinitely
  blue-shifted and infinitely intense. Both the blue-shift and
  intensity fall off with receiver time. This produces an effect
  qualitatively similar to the observations of gamma-ray bursts.


If this theory is correct then, intriguingly, it might offer an
alternative explanation for the source of gravitational waves.


Black Hole Mergers
==================

When a potential signal is detected it is compared to a catalogue of
waveforms for black hole mergers.

Once a good match has been located it is possible to calculate the
distance of the source based on how the amplitude of the wave we
receive compared to what it must have been at source.

Detectors also report the time and phase of the wave.

With three detectors this can narrow the source to an arc across the sky
of a few hundred degrees for the 90% confidence region.

In general, tends to be very elongated across the sky.  Earth based
detectors only have a limited baseline and so even with multiple
detectors the 90% confidence intervals tend to be large.

It does however provide a guide of which regions to turn telescopes to
in order to detect any radiation beyond the gravitational wave, so
called *multi-messenger* astronomy.

There is a system of alerts that puts out lists of potential candidate
galaxies where the wave might have originated.

One of the aims of this project is to try to explore mergers of binary
systems using the mathematics of the new paradigm and to investigate
whether the inertial drag affects the way binary systems merge. 

It seems likely there will be significant differences and so in turn,
given a sample of gravitational wave detections we would get a
different population of binary collisions.

This in turn could affect sky localisation, in particular, the
distance part of that calculation.


Sky localisation
================

Sky localisation data can be obtained from the ligo database:
https://gracedb.ligo.org

The data comes in the form of *.fitz* which use the *healpix* format.
This gives a full sky map with each pixel representing an equal area.

These work with phase, time and amplitude from the detectors which
detected the signal.

The amplitude is based on templates for various size black hole
collisions and assumes that Einstein's General Relativity is a good
enough approximation.

One goal here is to see how different gravitational waves from a black
hole merger would be under the new paradigm.

If there are significant differences then with enough observations
this should help determine which model is correct.

If EGR is correct then we should over time find that the localisations
making sense, successfully locate host galaxies for an event and
improve the chances of observing coincident radiation.

Likewise if the new paradigm is correct, we should have more success
finding host galaxies using that model.

There is another intriguing possibility.  This is that with the
physics of the new paradigm, binary system mergers are less violent
events that do not in fact create significant gravitational waves.
