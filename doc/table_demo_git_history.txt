commit 5348ce9551e2975050a495af1259294f03d3af12
Author: Antony Lee <anntzer.lee@gmail.com>

    Cleanups: Broadcasting, np.hypot, np.pi, etc.
    
    Also fixes a bug in fill_between with masked data.  In the modified test
    figures, the area in green is supposed to correspond to the part of the
    hatched area where the curve is below y=2.  The new behavior is the
    correct one.
    
    Also fixes cbook._reshape2D for scalar object inputs.  Before the fix,
    `plt.hist(None)` would fail with `x must have 2 or fewer dimensions`,
    which it does have.  Now it fails with a bit later with `unsupported
    operands type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'float'`, which is hopefully
    clearer.
