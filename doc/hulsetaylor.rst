 Binary Star
=============

`blume.twins` is an attempt to simulate binary stars as they orbit
around each other.

In the physics of NP, we have to take account the inertial drag due to
the rotations of the two stars, on each other and the surrounding
space.

My suspicion is that, once this is taken into account, it is very much
more likely that one of the stars explodes as a supernova, before they
spiral into each other.

Such an event would be a natural way for a planetary system to form,
out of the debris of the explosion, with the nova's twin as the new
sun.

If this suspicion is true, then what is causing the gravitational
waves that the LIGO and Virgo detectors are discovering?

NP may also have an answer to that riddle, that gravitational waves
are, like gamma-ray-bursts, a curious artefact of space-time, marking
the arrival of a new galaxy in our visible universe.

The good news is we may not have long to wait.  The current
observation run is drawing to a close, with some 50 waves having been
detected.

More instruments are coming on line, with sensitivity set to increase
too. 

**Weak Sciama principle:**::

  A mass *m* at distance *r* from *P* rotating with angular velocity *w*
  contributes a rotation of *kmw/r* to the inertial field at *P*, 
  where k is a constant.

Imagine an orange, the inside hollowed out and filled with peas.

Imagine the peas are a little spaced out and all spinning at the same
speed around axes which are (locally) parallel.

Imagine also that the whole orange is spinning with some angular
velocity, very much less than that of the peas.

A hypothesis of NP is that linear motions have no inertial effect, it
is just rotations we need to concern ourselves with.

Further, two rotations with the same angular velocity, differ only by
a constant velocity.

Consider a body such as a planet, with the peas being the atoms making
up the planet.

The inertial effect of the atomic rotations is the same as if they are
all at the centre of the planet.

Einstein's theory of gravity, captures the primary rotation, that of
the atoms, but not the secondary rotation.


Gravitomagnetism
================


If you pass a conductor through a moving magnetic field it induces a
current in the conductor.

This is the principle behind dynamos and electric motors.

Gravitomagnetism is a theory of gravity, a generalisation of Maxwell's
equations.

If I am understanding correctly, electro-magnetism is just a special
case.
