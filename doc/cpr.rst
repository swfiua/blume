The *U* in BLUME stands for `universal`.

The `blume.cpr` module is where it starts to come into life.

First, to reproduce the plots in *A new paradigm for the universe*.

Explore geodesics in *de Sitter Space*.

Binary systems and the *new paradigm*, when *M* is large and *r* is small?

How do they make waves?

Where do the harmonics arise in the CMB?  Is it just the *local
galaxies* that modulate the signal?

There is good data on local galaxies, so a first step here will be to
visualise these galaxies and see if we explore what seems to drive it
all.

There are a lot of parameters for each galaxy, which should allow a
reasonable model for the size of the black hole driving the galaxy.

If we can get reasonable estimates then we should start to see the
forces driving inter-galactic dust and be able to compare to harmonics
in the CMB.

It would also be of interest to see how the new paradigm changes
planetary formation theory and movements of dust through a solar
system and beyond.

For more on *Colin P. Rourke**, the inspiration behind all this, then
`universal` is a good place to learn more.

The `cpr` module is a first stab at implementing the physics of
his book, *A new paradigm for the universe*, in `python`.

All errors, and there are likely may be many, are on me for now.

Like most good mysteries, the more you explore, insights rapidly raise
a flurry of more intriguing questions.
