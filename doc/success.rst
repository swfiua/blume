========================
 Python's excel problem
========================

It only takes 100 lines or so of code to get a view of some data.

It may take a while, to unravel the data, create some meta data, in
the form of few hundred lines of python.

Powerful systems can be built with 1000 lines of code.

How to share what has been done with others?

At some point we either stop or gain some tools that save some
repetitive work.

Now we may descend into a rabbit warren of tool building and never
actually use the tools to do anything.

The language can do wonders.

Some magic pattern matching coming with 3.10.  That might come in
handy, but it might be a year before 3.10 comes with the OS.

For now it is good to know what might be possible.
