I am trying a temporary(?) experiment with David Beazeley's
`dataklasses`_

It is a fascinating experiment in very light weight sharing of code.

I should including the README.md too.

You can do a lot in a hundred lines of python, how to share it with
others?

Just put the module out there in a git repository somewhere.

You can take a copy, knowing the source may disappear, and use it as
you will.

*git* provides everything you need to manage any changes, so in the
unlikely event I add anything David might actually want, it is plain
sailing.

There should be a name for this sort of code exchange.

Somewhere like a cheese shop, where you can sample the goods before
comitting to a rare camembert.
