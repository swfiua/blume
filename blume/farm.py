"""Split the farm from magic.

The reason for this split is a growing belief that almost everything in the farm,
and the Farm itself should be some sort of Ball.

And wanting the default Farm to have a basic structure running with
everything a typical Ball might need, it needs to import some examples
from other modules.  Since those modules use magic, the end result is
a circular import.

This splt also allows me to think about what lives where.  And how
everything relates.  

Plan
====

This Farm is currently just a directed graph.  It feels like round
abouts should be the graph nodes, with their edges being the graph
edges.

That should simplify things a little from the current code.

I would like to change how the graph connects objects dynamically, in
a similar way to the way I can change attributes of running Ball's
with the magic.Interact object.

The Farm seems the right place -- or maybe the Shepherd?

Objects with a start and a run.

That might start and run each other.

Balls can write things to a queue.

The plan in magic land is to get the magic roundabout working.

At the moment there is a magic roundabout for each Ball.
